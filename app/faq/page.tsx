                  The EXP Bank is a special financial system that allows players to deposit gems and earn compound interest over time. 
                  With a fixed 0.15% daily interest rate, the bank provides a reliable way to grow your gem wealth passively.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                  Unlike traditional investments, the EXP Bank guarantees this rate regardless of market conditions, making it an 
                  excellent option for both new and experienced players looking to maximize their long-term gem growth.

                  Interest in the EXP Bank is calculated using compound interest at a daily rate of 0.15%. Compound interest means you 
                  earn interest not only on your initial deposit but also on the interest already accumulated.

                <p className="mt-2">
                  The formula used is: <strong>FV = PV Ã— (1 + r)^t</strong> where:

                How accurate is the calculator?

              <AccordionContent className="text-base">
                <p>
                  Our calculator provides highly accurate results using the BigNumber.js library, which ensures precision even when 
                  dealing with extremely large numbers (billions of gems). The calculations match exactly what you'll receive in the 
                  actual EXP Bank system.

                <p className="mt-2">
                  For very long time periods (multiple years) or extremely large gem amounts (trillions+), there might be minor 
                  rounding differences, but these are negligible for practical purposes. All time calculations account for leap years 
                  and accurate day counts between dates.

                <p>
                  Yes, you can withdraw your gems from the EXP Bank at any time without penalties. However, to maximize your returns, 
                  it's generally recommended to leave your gems deposited for longer periods to take advantage of compound interest.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                  Keep in mind that once you withdraw gems, you'll no longer earn interest on that amount. You can use our calculator's 
                  "Goal Gems" feature to determine the optimal time to withdraw if you're saving for a specific amount.

                  The EXP Bank has a minimum deposit requirement of 100 gems to open an account. There is no maximum limit to how many 
                  gems you can deposit, and the system can handle amounts in the billions or even trillions.

                  The Goal Gems feature helps you determine how long it will take to reach a specific gem amount. To use it:

                </ol>
                <p className="mt-2">
                  This feature is particularly useful for planning major purchases or setting savings milestones. You can also combine 
                  it with the time period calculator to see how close you'll get to your goal within a specific timeframe.

                    This is useful when you want to know your returns after a certain investment period.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Future Date</strong>: Calculates growth up to a specific calendar date (e.g., December 31, 2023). 
                    This is useful when you have a target date in mind, such as saving for something on a specific date.

                  The EXP Bank's interest rate is fixed at 0.15% daily and has remained unchanged since the system was implemented.

                  This consistent rate is one of the key advantages of the EXP Bank, as it allows for reliable long-term planning and 
                  predictable returns. If there were ever to be a rate change, an announcement would be made well in advance.
